***by John Bunyan***


### Forthcoming

**Summary:**<br>

_The Pilgrim’s Progress_ by John Bunyan (1628-1688) remains essential reading because its spiritual truth and lyrical beauty endure. Bunyan asks readers to “lay my book, your head and heart together.”

In _The Pilgrim’s Progress_, Bunyan has pictured for readers the journey of a lifetime. His audience can have no better response than that of Christiana: “I think it is now time to rise and to know what we must do.”

(From the book's "Introduction" by Eric C. Schaefer, PhD.)
